# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# # Numbers
# puts 5
# puts 2

# # Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 5 + 2
# puts 5 - 2.0
# puts 5.00 / 2.00
# puts 5 * 2 + 1

# # Strings
# puts "connor"

# # Combine strings together
# puts "connor" + + " " + "steiner"

# Variables
first_name = "connor"
last_name = "steiner"

# Combine strings and variables
puts first_name + last_name
puts "#{first_name}.#{last_name}@kellogg.northwestern.edu"

# String manipulation
first_name = first_name + ".i"
puts "#{first_name}.#{last_name}@kellogg.northwestern.edu"
